            <p>And here you are, too. Is this where you thought you'd be?</p>
            <p>We all start out thinking we know where we're going. We have our dreams, of course, which is fine. Dreams give us direction. They keep us engaged. The trouble comes when we stop dreaming and start planning.</p>
            <p>Plans are useful and concrete. They narrow our options, which is great if you're deciding which shampoo to buy or where to have the company picnic. But they're no good at all for deciding how we want our lives to go. You see, there's a not-so-secret secret you should know by now:</p>
            <p id="something-else">Nothing ever goes the way you planned.</p>
          <h3>I like surprises.</h3>
            <p>Well, as much as the next person, anyway. So...not very much. </p>
            <p>Oh, sure. Surprise cakes are good. Suprise lottery winnings are more than good. Gotta get me some of that. Surprise vision loss is less good. Bad, even. You bring me a box full of that, and i'm not inviting you next year.</p>
          <h3>Is this supposed to be my gift?</h3>
            <p>In a word: No.</p>
            <p>I'm no Pollyanna. My disability serves no greater purpose. We live in a visual world, and blindness makes everything exponentially more difficult. It's been three years since I started losing my sight and some days, I can still summon that fresh, bright fury. There is no way to spin it.</p>
          <h3>But my life isn't over.</h3>
            <p>That's the most important thing to remember, whenever something knocks you sideways. You're still breathing? Then you're not done. Pick it up. Sort it out. Move along. Find the people who can help you. <a href="http://www.dsb.wa.gov/">These folks</a> helped me. And let the surprises remind you of those dreams you had before you winnowed them skinny with plans.</p>
            <p class="more-content">So here I am. Here you are, too. And if neither of us is exactly what we thought we'd be--well, that's what you'd expect, isn't it? There've been so many surprises.</p>
