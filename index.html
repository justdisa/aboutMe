          <h1>Well, here I am.</h1>
            <div class = "spacer">                   </div>
            <p>I assume you're here, too, even though I can't see you very well. Is this where you thought you'd be?</p>
            <p>We all start out thinking we know where we're going. We have our dreams, of course, which is fine. Dreams give us direction. They keep us engaged. The trouble comes when we stop dreaming and start planning.</p>
            <p>Plans are useful and concrete. They narrow our options, which is great if you're deciding which shampoo to buy or where to have the company picnic. But they're no good at all for deciding how we want our lives to go, and they're really bad at handling surprises. You see, there's a not-so-secret secret you should know by now:</p>
            <p id="something-else">Nothing ever goes the way you planned.</p>
          <div class = "spacer">                   </div>
          <h3>I like surprises.</h3>
            <p>Well, as much as the next person, anyway. On my own terms, in my own time, and under controlled circumstances. So...not very much. </p>
            <p>Oh, sure. Some surprises are great:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Surprise vacations</li>
              <li>Suprise lottery winnings <br>(gotta get me some of that)</li>
              <li>Surprise cakes.</li>
              <li>Surprise parties</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Surprise vision loss is less good. Bad, even. You bring me a box full of that, and I'm not inviting you next year.</p>

          <div class = "spacer">                   </div>
          <h3>Is this supposed to be my gift?</h3>
            <p>In a word: No.</p>
            <p>I'm no Pollyanna. I'm not strong or virtuous because I can't see. Not everything happens for a reason. And I didn't get Daredevil super senses to compensate.</p>
            <p>We live in a visual world, and blindness makes everything exponentially more difficult. It's been three years since I started losing my sight and some days, I can still summon that fresh, bright fury. There is no way to spin it.</p>
            <p>And I'm not unique. In the United States, 8% of people over forty experience some degree of vision loss. That's not something they're born with. It jumps up in midlife (surprise!) to derail their plans.</p>
          <div class = "spacer">                   </div>
          <h3>My life isn't over.</h3>
            <p>And yours isn't, either. That's the most important thing to remember, whenever something knocks you sideways. You're still breathing? Then you're not done. Pick it up. Sort it out. Move along.</p>
            <p>There are resources available for you. These are focused on visual impairment, but there are similar things for every disability. Use them.</p>

              <li>Most major cities have a <a href="http://www.wtbbl.org/">Talking Book and Braille Library</a>. This is Seattle's.</li>

              <li><a href="http://seattlelighthouse.org/">The Lighthouse for the Blind</a>. This is the one in Seattle. There are many.</li>
              <li>If you're a veteran, talk to the <a href="https://www.va.gov/">V.A.</a></li>
              <li>If you're a student, talk to your advisor about the resources your school might have available to you.</li>
              <li>And last, but not least, remember you can still check stuff out from your local public library.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Don't forget that people can help you, too. The folks I met <a href="http://www.dsb.wa.gov/">here</a>, teachers and students alike, helped me a lot. So did literal dozens of other people. All you have to do is ask them.</p>
            <p>And let the surprises remind you of those dreams you had before you winnowed them skinny with plans.</p>
            <p class="more-content">So here I am. Here you are, too. And if neither of us is exactly what we thought we'd be--well, that's what you'd expect, isn't it? There've been so many surprises.</p>
